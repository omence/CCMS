            <p class="para-1">
                I have worked in the social services field for fifteen years, and one issue I have encountered time and time again is the lack of ability for nonprofits to coordinate and communicate with each other regarding shared clientele.  This Community Case Management System will make it possible to share information regarding currently available resources.  It will give nonprofits the ability to send referrals directly to other nonprofits across the state.  Participating nonprofits will have a fully functional case management system similar to ones used by large government organizations. Finally, and most importantly nonprofits will have the ability, with written consent of the client, to share and read progress notes from partnering nonprofits in order to maximize the benefit to the client and eliminate wasted time and resources.  This application will revolutionize social service delivery.

They will have the ability to make posts about available resources or upcoming events.  They will be able to delete their posts when they are no longer needed or edit them as needed.  Nonprofits will have the ability to follow the posts of other nonprofits in a “My Community” section of the application.  Users will have the ability to search the message board by keyword.  This section will keep the rest of the community informed about your organization and will keep you informed about others.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The Community Case Managements System will allow organizations to collaborate in two ways.  First, users will have the ability to send referrals directly to other organizations through a message portal.  The user will be able to save the referrals they send so they can follow up at a later date.  Second, with the written consent of the client, organizations will have the ability to share their progress notes with partnering organizations who are assisting the same client.  They will also have the ability to read the progress notes from those partners.  This will help keep all stakeholders informed about the client’s progress, it will help eliminate duplicate resource dispersal, and will create cross organizational teams that will be better equipped to serve the needs of their clients.  </p>

We will be implementing Microsoft’s free and opensource Machine Learning Framework ML.NET in order to deliver the highest quality analytics that current technology can provide.  Machine learning is currently used to predict your next purchase, it is used to determine which social media post you see and what advertisements will be most effective.  We are going to use Machine Learning for positive social change. Intersectionality is real and can be incredibly complex, we will use Machine Learning to make predictions about what combination of services are most effective for various groups.  This will provide every participating organization with accurate feedback which they can use to make adjustments to their service delivery.  </p>
